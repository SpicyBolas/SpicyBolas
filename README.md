- 👋 Hi, I’m @SpicyBolas
- 👀 I’m interested in applying data science techniques to better understand and make predictions around real-world systems. 
- 🌱 My background is in engineering and controls, using optimisation and a control theory approach to model and automate industrial processes. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to expand my data science skills and seek to collaborate on a project appying neural networks to the prediction of stock exchange trends.
